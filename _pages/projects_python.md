# Python Projects

## SWAPOWN
[SWAPOWN](https://github.com/Bryan351018/SWAPOWN) stands for **S**ynth **W**aveform **A**nalysis on **P**arameterized **O**scillators and **W**hite **N**oise, and it is a suite of python programs that graphs how frequency distributions change when a synthesizer waveform gets morphed (like from a square wave to a triangle wave).

## Robotics
There are multiple python programs I have written for robots built in the LEGO® Mindstorms® EV3 system, which is now discontinued.
